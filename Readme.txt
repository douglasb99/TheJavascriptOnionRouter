Explanation of how site works is on site: thejor.com/about

All files/functions other than those explicitly labelled otherwise were written by me in 
a) static
b)  static/other_components

These constitute most of the application. The server-side code is comprised of largely

server.js + captchas.js + utils folder + ipblock.js.
